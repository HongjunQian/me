Reflection:
I found it difficult to translate my thinking process into a block of code.For exercise 4 I checked Youtube video to help me do the coding.

Question for set 3 exercise 1 stubborn_asker

What is raw_input?I google the meaning but I'm still confused. If input() takes the value while raw_input takes a string why should we use int() while using input()?

Also, I can't run the official test for this week's exercise. I typed python ..\course\set3\tests.py but it returns something like "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'". And my VScode takes forever to run formatter and prettier when saving and I have to cancel them.
