TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
exercise1: List of programming volcabulary:
    "call" =  do or execute a specific function
    "return" = ends the executed function and get the result
    "function" = a block of code that can be referenced by name to run the code it contains
    "argument" = the information contained in the function
    "syntax" = rules of programming language
    "array" = a set of objects that are all the same type of data
    "loop" =  a sequence of instruction that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached

exercise2: it prints <function set2exersise2 at 0x0000018396E7CEA0>

Reflection:
This week I learned how to do loops and print lists with my code. But I found myself unable to complete 
exercise3 based on what I have learned from the lecture slides. I watched the answers vedio andntrying 
hard to understand the logic behind it, and it's a bit painful.

Question for Set2, exercise3, loops_1c: 

I'm unclear about loops_1c because I have passed the test but the answer is not quite right.
It prints:['×°×', '×°×', '×°×', '×°×'] instead of ['#', '#', '#', '#', '#']
I have tried using str() to change the variables but it did not work.

Finally. I apologize for the late submission. I got a bad cold since last weekend.
I would be greatful if you can still accept my homework.
