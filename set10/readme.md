TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
To be honest, at first I got no idea about plotting with pandas. But when I start doing it (and use chatGPT to explain to me some basic questions, for example, what is a markdown cell) I started getting to know the tool and jupyter notebook.
For me, it is pretty fun to create graph for the open data project, but I think there could be more example of plot on the sample sheet.
Like pie chart, interactive chart, etc. For my chosen dataset, the histogram is not that useful.
